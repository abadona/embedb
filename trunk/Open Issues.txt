Open issues for BTree

? FLAGS_UNIQUE into FLAGS_DUPLICATE
### done ### insert and insertAt return ERR_DUPLICATE
### done, searchNode and insertAt ### who combines key and value for duplicate
  searchNode, insertAt or upper level
implement delete
copy and rotate too complicated

write roadmap for btree code

  BTreeNodeHandler implements most generic methods
itself, but relies on some functionality of concrete
subclasses.
  Next subclass in chain, FixedNodeHandler implements
fixed unique key, non range value, but do it in a
way which allows to modify it to support non-unique
key in class DupKeyNodeHandler by concatenating key
and value, and support range values by modifying
procedures of extracting and inserting values into
the tree.
  VariableNodeHandler is unfunctional now, but it supposed
to support variable keys. Probably it is easier and
more effective to implement Patricia over B-tree,
kind of Ferragina works for valiable length keys.

Left and right sibling links are not necessary for internal nodes.
Usually in B+ Tree only right link is used for mutlithreaded
operations because key can travel into next node.
