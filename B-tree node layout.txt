  Eight basic layouts for B-tree node exist. They are formed by three independent
parameters - whether it is a fixed or variable length key index, is it an internal
or leaf node, and is index uses range coding. Two of them - variable index with
range coding, both internal and leaf nodes, does not make sense.
  Two parameters are shown explicitely, while the third - range coding - determines
vallen (and value layout, which is not shown ). In case of non-range coding, value
is a 8-byte integer, which is an object id. In case of range coding, value is a 12
byte structure, which consists of 8-byte recno and 4-byte range.
  In case of variable keys, an array of accumulated key length is stored, with the
first element always being 0, and the last (nkeys+1) element being total length of
all keys. This layout allows for fast finding beginning of each key as well as size
which is the difference between the beginning of next element and the current one.
  Each key in internal nodes corresponds to pointer to the pages with keys LESS OR
EQUAL to this key. That is for leaf node, the largest key in the node is duplicated
at its parent.
